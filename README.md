# context-hook-test

Made with the default template using the Preact CLI.

## Purpose

This demonstrates an issue where components don't re-render on context provider change as expected if there is more than one level of nesting using the `children` argument.

## CLI Commands

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and preact-render-spy
npm run test
```
